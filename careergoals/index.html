<h1> Career Goals: </h1>

At the moment I am maintaining a 3.43 GPA at Ohio State and finishing my second year here.
So far I have had exposure to Java, C, x86 Assembler, C++, and C# through my classes at Ohio
State. Furthermore, I have completed our algorithms and data structures track. Last summer I
worked as an intern at Enterprise Security here at Ohio State. I worked with our governance and
compliance team and helped Facilitate document submissions for an external audit on PCI
(Payment Card Industry) compliance from over 10 different departments. In addition I helped
improve PCI compliance by mapping controls back to university policy requirements. Later in
the summer, I began to work on risk assements and performed these and external software and
gathered data using Open Source Intelligence.

In terms of software engineering I have worked on small projects during the school year. One
project I did was a Chess Expected-to-Lose (ELO) Calculator using Python. What this did was log
and display ELO scores of players, with the user being capable of adding and deleting players,
calculating the odds of a win, logging a match, clearing and displaying statistics.

In terms of extra-curriculars I am heavily invested in the OHI/O Club, which Plans and hosts
multiple hackathons at OSU, with the largest hackathon having over 850+ participants. Next year
I am in charge of Make OHI/O, a hardware-based hackathon which had over 180 participants in
2019. Being the lead, I am responsible for leading a team of students in planning all aspects of the
hackathon, while coordinating with companies with regards to sponsorships and logistics. This
year, I helped coordinate the registration of high school partipants in the 2019 High School I/O,
update the main website with hackathon information using HTML and CSS using Git, and worked
on the logistics of the and planning the showcase after Hack OHI/O 2018
